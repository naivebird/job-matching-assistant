**Note:** This resume highlights relevant skills such as community involvement, attention to presentation and service quality, teamwork, and a passion for coffee—all aligned with Xtraction Co.'s values and expectations.","<p>Xtraction Co. is looking to add a key player or two to its staff for the end of this year and into the next. Working within a team and becoming a part of the local communities. We would love to create a home for someone looking to improve their coffee knowledge and who considers themselves personable. This role is designed with the intention of the successful applicant being able to take the lead and progress within the business.</p><p><strong>Who are we;</strong><br /> Xtraction Co. was first opened in 2013 with the sole purpose of bringing specialty coffee to the city of Newcastle. Since then it has always pushed the boundaries of brewing whilst always pouring an amazing cup.<br />Our mission today is the same today as it was then, but now with an intent and commitment to being a valuable member of our community.</p><p><strong>What we are looking for;</strong></p><ul><li>Community focused<br />The individual that we're looking for is someone who wants to be a part of the team. We want someone who wants to know every person who comes to see them and appreciates that action for the awesome opportunity it is. They should want to look for opportunities where they and by extension the company can help the community by sponsoring teams and organisations within the area and truly become apart of it all. </li><li>Perfectionist<br />This evolves far beyond simply making good coffee and food. Being a perfectionist should encase every area of your day whilst in the store. From the presentation of the store before the first locals walk in, the first interaction that our locals get when they walk in and how promptly they receive that welcoming. The people who dine in should be made to feel like guests who we are trying to impress. Not patrons where the objective is to finish a ticket. Of course, intertwined within the this service model is presenting some of the most delicious and well presented food and coffee that you are capable of producing! </li><li>Friendly<br />Extending from the last point, this candidate would be friendly by nature. Someone to whom saying hello in passing to a stranger on the street is an involuntary reaction more than a conscious thought. They should find enjoyment from seeing other people have a great experience and take pride in the fact that the team that they nurture and take care of can make so many peoples day even just a bit brighter.</li><li>Hard working <br />We know that all of this isn't effortless. Creating an experience that makes people feel happy and bright is a series of 1% effort areas that we strive to hit with every single person who gives us the opportuity. There are some amazing cafes and places to eat and drink in Newcastle. If someone is willing to choose us then we want to put in the effort to make that choice more than worthwhile. </li></ul><p><strong>Who you are</strong></p><p>You are someone who when reading this, got excited and wasn't scared from the prospect of all the avenues to monitor.
